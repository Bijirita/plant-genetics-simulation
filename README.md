# plant genetics simulation

a simulation for the cross-pollination of plants, created using JS

### view the simulation [here](https://jakethakur22.github.io/plant-genetics-simulation/index.html)

## currently supported plants and alleles

### plants

currently only tulips are supported

### alleles

currently only red and white alleles for tulips are supported, in the hierarchy **red > white**

## future updates

* I might update the simulation in the future to allow custom definitons of plants and their allele hierarchy

please open an issue if you find any bugs or have any feature suggestions
